# Selenium Hybrid Framework

This project is a Selenium hybrid framework designed using Python programming language, pytest, and Selenium WebDriver. The framework provides a structured approach for automating web testing tasks with flexibility and scalability.

## Features

- Hybrid Approach: Combines the advantages of both data-driven and keyword-driven testing methodologies.
- Modular Design: Test scripts are organized into reusable modules for better maintainability.
- Page Object Model (POM): Utilizes the POM design pattern to separate web page objects from test logic.
- Test Data Management: Supports external data sources such as Excel, CSV, or JSON files for test data input.
- Reporting: Generates detailed test reports with pytest's built-in reporting capabilities.
- Cross-Browser Testing: Supports testing across multiple web browsers using Selenium WebDriver's browser drivers.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language used for test script development.
- pytest: Testing framework for writing and executing test cases.
- Selenium WebDriver: Browser automation tool used for interacting with web elements.
- External Data Sources: Utilizes Excel, CSV, or JSON files for managing test data.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the Selenium hybrid framework locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Configure the test environment: Set up browser drivers for the desired browsers.
5. Write test scripts: Create test scripts using pytest and Selenium WebDriver APIs.
6. Organize test data: Prepare test data in external files (Excel, CSV, JSON).
7. Run tests: Execute test cases using the command `pytest`.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to improve the framework are welcome! You can open an issue to report bugs or suggest enhancements, or submit a pull request with your changes.
